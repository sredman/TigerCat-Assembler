# Description : This is a two-player Snake game for the TigerCat architecture
#

# Coding syle suggestions:
# - Use very verbose label names. There is no scoping, so using simple names
#   like "LOOP" will quickly get confusing
# - Indent two spaces after every label for the "body" of that label, where
#   appropriate
# - Try to limit lines to 80 characters
# - Leave very verbose header comments on methods. Be very clear about what
#   and how many arguments to use
# - All registers are CALLER SAVED

# Data type definitions:
# String:
# Array of 8-bit values, read until the 8-bit value 0x0 is encountered
# The shortest possible string would be 0x0000, while the one-length string "a"
# would be 0x6100, and a two-length string "aa" would be, in two consequtive 
# memory addresses, 0x6161 0x0000
# Snake:
# Game Board:

# Define your constants here!
VGA_TEXT_BASE_ADDR=0x7FE000 # Stuff written starting here will be drawn to the screen
CONTROLLER_1_READ_ADDR=0x7FDBDB # Read from controller 1 here
CONTROLLER_2_READ_ADDR=0x7FDBDE # Read from controller 2 here
# End constants

# Main game loop


# Error Print
# Read a string starting from %arg1 and put it on the screen
# Arguments:
# %arg1: String to print
# %a2l: Colour to print (lower 8 bits)
# Returns:
# void
ERROR_PRINT:
  # Interesting Registers:
  # %s1l - The current and next 8-bit character to write
  # %s1h - The current character to write
  # %arg3 - Destination address into the ASCII section
